% Objective Characterization of Audio Signal Quality
% Application to Music Collection Description

% Implementation inspired by:
% Dominique Fourer and Geoffroy Peeters,
% "Objective Characterization of Audio Signal Quality: Application to
% Music Collection Description,"

% Processing (ICASSP), March 2017, New Orleans, USA.

% Description:
% This code implements feature extraction and/or analysis methods described
% in the above paper, with a focus on objective audio quality characterization.
% It may include descriptors related to spectral, temporal, and perceptual
% properties of audio signals, and can be used for tasks such as:
%   - Audio quality assessment
%   - Music collection description
%   - Audio processing characterization (e.g., DRC discrimination)
%
% Notes:
% - This is a research-oriented implementation and may not exactly reproduce
%   the original results.
% - Ensure proper citation if used in academic work.
